# rusty xkcd bot
A copy of [Solarflame5's Xkcd Bot](https://github.com/Solarflame5/xkcd-bot/) built in Rust instead of Python to achieve the best performance.
[Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1033416023627546654&permissions=277025441792&scope=bot) to add the bot to your Discord server (24/7)

## Important
This is my first project using Rust. It is likely far from being good, however, pull requests are welcome to improve the code (and help me learn)!

## How to run it
Clone the repository, build it and then run it. Upon its first run, it'll create a file called `token.txt`. You have to put your bot token in that file so the bot can start. Once done, run the bot and invite it to your server. Success!
